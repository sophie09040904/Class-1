                answer: "One of my challenges is that I sometimes find it hard to say no because I want to maintain a positive and helpful attitude with everyone. This has occasionally led to situations where I do not have enough time for my own tasks. For instance, my manager once asked me to help with his work, and I stayed up late to complete my own. However, I am working on this by politely setting boundaries. Now, I say, 'I have something urgent to finish. Would it be okay if I help you later?' This way, I can manage my time better while still being supportive to others."
